            <b>INFORMATION COLLECTED USING COOKIES:</b> Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer
            through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with
            each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how
            and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet. Our cookies do not, by
            themselves, contain Personal Information. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web
            browser has accessed aspects of the Services. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie
            feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the
            sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a
            variety of ways. This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by

            websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer. Ads appearing on the Services may be
            delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
            recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or
            others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
            advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
            cookies by Conquest Advisors and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, including

            provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this
